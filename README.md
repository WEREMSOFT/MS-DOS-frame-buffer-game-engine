# Old School Frame Buffer game engine
Old school, MS-DOS golden era game engine where you create images by writing into a memory region, that is pushed to the video card.

# Dependencies
GLFW and Glew

# Usage
Read the main.c, program.c (function mainLoop) and the graphics.h to get at basic understanding of how to use it(should be enough).
